## My Solutions to Exercises:

### 1. What Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training set with millions of features?

> Using gradient descent for models that has more than 10,000 features. specifically, use Stochastic GD or mini-batch when training set doesn't fit into memory, batch GD can be applied when fit. Normal equation is not practical when the features' number are too large since the computational complexity is around O(n^3)

### 2. Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. What algorithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?

> Gradient Descent needs feature scaling. It will take a longer time if data are not normalized. usually use Mean Normalization. while normal Equation doesn't have this problem

### 3. Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic Regression model?

> Not at all since the logistics curve's loss function is convex. GD will finally reach the optimal solution.

### 4. Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model provided you let them run long enough?

> It depends, if the cost function is convex and learning rate is right, all GD will converge at the global optimal solution. but as SGD & mini-batch are erratic, it means they'll jump back & forth around the optimal solution. Traing SGD for a long time doesn't guarantee it will get nearer to the target, they do not truly converge, so the model might be a little different.  

### 5. Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at every epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is likely going on? How can you fix this?

> If validation error is high but training error is low, then it might because the model overfits the test set which results in low generalization capability. Solutions: feed more data; do cross-validation; regularization
If both validation error & training error are high, then the possible case is that learning rate is too high which causes the model diverge, we should reduce learning rate.

### 6. Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up?

> nope. both SGD & mini-batch GD's performace are not stable due to their random nature, they fluctuate all the time. doesn't gurantee progresss. A good solution to this is saving your model periodically, if after a long time it doesn't beat the best performance, then stop training. 

### 7. Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the vicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How can you make the others converge as well?

> mini-batch GD is the fastest GD, Batch GD will actually converge. Do proper learning schedule, use early stopping when necessary.

## 8. Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and you notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation error. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?

> overfitting - if the validation error is much higher than training error; 1. feed more data, 2. regularize, 3. decrease degree
---
### 9. Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error and the validation error are almost *equal and fairly high*. Would you say that the model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regularization hyperparameter Î± or reduce it?

> underfitting(when training error is high & equal to vlidation error roughly): reduce hyperparameter to eliminate bias

### 10. Why would you want to use:
Ridge Regression instead of Linear Regression?
Lasso instead of Ridge Regression?
Elastic Net instead of Lasso?

> 

* Ridge, by default; (a model with regularizatin usually perform better than those don't, prefer Ridge than plain linear regression
* Lasso when assuming there're less important features; (use L1 penalty which tends to push the insignificatn weights down to 0)
* Elastic Net: #feature > #instance or features are mutally correlated (where Lasso behave erratically) 
---
### 11. Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime. Should you implement two Logistic Regression classifiers or one Softmax Regression classifier?

> use 2 logistic regression classifiers since Softmax Regression focus on 1 class of data at 1 time while the problem has two type of class.

### 12. Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression (without using Scikit-Learn).
